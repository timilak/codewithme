# This is a comment! Python ignores it!
# This piece of code is about python operators

# arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, **
a = 15
b = 6
print (a+b)
print (a-b)
print (a*b)
print (a/b)         #remainder
print (a**b)        #exponent

# logical operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
print (b!=a)         # not equal
print (b==a)
print (b>a)
print (b<a)
print (b>=a)        # greater than or equal
print (b<=a)        # less than or equal

# output will be True or False (Boolean)

# logical operators: and , or, not
